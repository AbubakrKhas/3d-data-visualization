# 3D Data Visualization Project

This project is a 3D data visualization tool built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It visualizes nodes and edges in a 3D space, providing an interactive experience for exploring data relationships.

## Features

- **3D Nodes and Edges**: Visualize data points as 3D objects with various shapes (cubes, spheres, etc.).
- **Interactive Controls**: Use OrbitControls and DragControls for intuitive navigation and manipulation of the 3D space.
- **Dynamic Labeling**: Each node can display a label for identification.
- **Expandable/Collapsible Nodes**: Nodes can have child nodes that can be toggled to show or hide, helping in managing complex data sets.
- **Edge Animation**: Edges connecting nodes can be animated, enhancing the visual experience.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-data-visualization.git

$python -m venv env
